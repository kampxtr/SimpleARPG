  I spend few days to create a 3D RPG with my 3D game engine. It's a multi-level ARPG, tremendous fun 
to play with. Here you can kill penguin mobs, loot items they drop, then equip the item. More exciting, 
you can use the level editor to create any level for the game, and choose which level to play with.
  Since my engine is pretty easy to use, I create the game efficiently. For me, I think the most challenge thing 
to do is 3D modeling in Blender, I spend nearly half a day to modify that knight model, do rigging, animating, 
attach equipment. To support equipment system I reconstructed the engine's animation system and did many 
optimization. After the gameplay finished, I create GUI system to add inventory system, and you can see the 
weapons, helmets you loot in the inventory window.
  As you notice, penguins are playing different animations, that's owe to my engine's new feathers !!! 
  When you switch to different level, your items will remain in your inventory repository and the equipments 
are still be attached, don't worry.
  Most significantly, i create animation blueprint to do animation control in editor, and don't need to write 
any lines of codes, very easy to drive !!!
  Lastly, you can enjoy the code, but i show the code just for ZHUANG B, so it can't compile, lol !!!
